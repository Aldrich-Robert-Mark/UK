I started this program to provide secure (encrypted) mail through the internet. I wanted to avoid the "email" mechanism because the original model is based on non-secure short messages between geeks and has be patched ever since. I also want to avoid the usual html problems. I started by using the C programming language, but then changed to C++. I am using SQLite3 as the local database management system and wxWindows as the GUI because these seem to be very well supported across operating systems.

I am stepping into this journal at a fairly early point in the development process, but not at the beginning, like I should have. I have built the section which reads and writes the configuration. I have also separated the GUI into it's own class. I am not sure at this point how/if I can keep the GUI separated.

The current state of the project is still local and the top-level or master window is displayed with a pull down file menu consisting only of a quit option which stops the program. At this point, I will save and restore the origin and size of this top window.

I am having difficulty getting the wxGridBagSizer function to work. Currently the code is:
<code>
    wxColour col1, col2;
    col1.Set(wxT("#00ff00"));
    col2.Set(wxT("#ff0000"));

    wxPanel *panel = new wxPanel(this, -1);
    panel->SetBackgroundColour(col1);

    layout->Add( panel1, wxGBPosition( 1, 1 ));
    panel->SetSizer( layout );

    wxGridBagSizer *vbox = new wxGridBagSizer( );
    gbSizer1 = wx.GridBagSizer( 0, 0 )
    wxGBPosition( 1, 1 )

    wxPanel *midPan = new wxPanel(panel, wxID_ANY);
    midPan->SetBackgroundColour(col2);

    vbox->Add( panel, );
    panel->SetSizer(vbox);
</code>
When I change the GridBagSizer to a BoxSizer (plus other changes), I can get a red background with a green square in the middle, like I expect. With the GridBagSizer, I do not see anything.
